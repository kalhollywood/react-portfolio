# Portfolio Project (Draft)

For this project I used [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com) from freeCodeCamp with my own slight modifications.
I did this project as I wanted to learn about Sass and improve my CSS skills. It's deployed to Netlify [here](https://glittering-kataifi-784b3f.netlify.app/).

## Key learnings

- In this project I learned that you can include a for loop in your CSS! I used the for loop to iterate through indexed letters in a string and add a 0.1s animation delay to each one to create the cool effect on the h1 headings on each page.
- On the About page I learned how to create a 3D spinning cube effect using just CSS.
- I learned about emailJS and was able to successfully set it up using the docs despite the tutorial not including any detailed information on this process.
- On the portfolio page I learned how to create a portfolio object and then map through this object as an easy way to add/change individual project details.

## Challenges

- Also not mentioned in the tutorial was the fact that React router dom has a bug when run with the latest version of React (18.2.0) which meant that the routes were not working and the home page component was stuck behind the sidebar component.
- Logo rotation on cube took a lot of tweaking to ensure panels displayed as a cube and in the right orientation
- Adapting for mobile responsiveness was difficult, particularly with the contact form
