# Portfolio Project

For this project I used [this tutorial](http://www.youtube.com) from freeCodeCamp with my own slight modifications.
I did this project as I wanted to learn about Sass and improve my CSS skills.

## Key learnings

- In this project I learned that you can include a for loop in your CSS! I used the for loop to iterate through indexed letters in a string and add a 0.1s animation delay to each one to create the cool effect on the h1 headings on each page.
- I learned about emailJS and was able to successfully set it up using the docs despite the tutorial not including any detailed information on this process.

## Challenges

- Also not mentioned in the tutorial was the fact that React router dom has a bug when run with the latest version of React (18.2.0) which meant that the routes were not working and the home page component was stuck behind the sidebar component.
